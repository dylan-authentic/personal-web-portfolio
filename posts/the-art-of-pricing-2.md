In "The Art of Pricing - Part I", I breakdown the aspects of pricing a product and concepts to consider when determining pricing. In this post, I breakdown the difference between Pricing Strategy and Pricing Model, as well as propose a framework that can be applied when tasked with determing pricing for a product.

##### Pricing Strategy vs Pricing Model

__Pricing Strategy__
- The pricing strategy defines the strategic approach to pricing.
- It describes "why" you set the price in the manner that you do.
- It is internal to the business and is aimed at aligning stakeholders.
- It seeks to achieve business goals and objectives.
- It influences the pricing models that are deployed.
- It is a theoretical approach to pricing.

__Pricing Model__
- The pricing model defines how the pricing strategy is operationalized.
- It describes "how" a product is priced and details the format of the price.
- It is a facet of how a product is packaged and presented to customers - often considered "packaging".
- It is external to the business and is amed at informing customers.
- It seeks to fulfill the pricing strategy.
- Several pricing models can deployed at once, and several pricing models can apply to various pricing strategies.
- It is the practical implementation to pricing.

##### Pricing Framework
__STEP 1: Goals & Objectives__
- Identify and define business goals and objectives.

__STEP 2: Strategy & Models__
- Identify and determine pricing strategy and models.

__STEP 3: Collect Data & Conduct Research__
- Define buyer personas, gather customer feedback about buying behavior and other key signals, calculate key financial metrics such as customer LTV, internal costs, break-even, etc., and gather competitor analysis for understanding current market trends.

__STEP 4: Experiment & Test__
- Run trial periods, validate pricing models and strategies with customers in the market, and collect key data signals.

__STEP 5: Analyze, Refine, Monitor__
- Analyze collected data, monitor buying activity and feedback, and refine pricing model and strategy until finalized.

# Product Strategy: Launching an E-Commerce Marketplace (Pt. 1)

###### Executive Summary
Due to the global pandemic accelerating consumer adoption of digital markets, e-commerce spending in the United States has experienced a 40% YOY increase in 2020. While retail has been transitioning online for more than a decade now, online shopping has become more of a defacto form of discovering and purchasing products for consumers than ever before. As a result, consumers are more likely to begin their search for products online with the intention of identifying products and brands that align with their preferences, interests, and purchasing habits. Within the current landscape of e-commerce, there exists a lane for community-driven retail that provides a fresh, digital shopping experience and connects shoppers with unfamiliar, yet trusted small and independent brands.

###### Problem Statement
__I am__ a young professional who is rising in my career, growing my income, and establishing a comfortable lifestyle that I enjoy. __I'm trying to__ shop from an online store that has a pleasant shopping experience and that helps me find quality products that I'll like from small businesses that I can trust. __But__, when I shop from online platforms, I am either overwhelmed with the amount of randomness, or I only go there to buy something specific that I can get quickly, or I don't know if the small business has quality products or good customer service. __Because__ there is no online store that emphasizes a fun and delightful shopping experience and that emphasizes shopping from small and independent businesses, __I feel__ unsure of buying from small businesses that I'm unfamiliar with online unless a friend recommends them to me.

###### Audience
- Young professionals with disposable income (~Ages 22-32) 
- Shoppers with the 'Browsing Customer' profile -- [Reference](https://fitsmallbusiness.com/shopper-profile/)
- Shoppers with a preference of shopping from small and independent brands

###### Competitive Landscape
- Amazon
- Etsy
- Instagram Shopping
- Pinterest
- Shopify

From a competitive perspective, e-commerce is an incredibly crowded market. Multiple players with large market caps are currently battling for the dollars of consumers. As a new entrant into this market, it would be next to impossible to compete with these platforms on delivery speed, selection, and reach. 

###### Competitive Strategy

In order to succeed in a competitive market, the strategy is to:
- Provide above and beyond customer service to establish trust and credibility
- Build personal relationships with customers based on authenticity to increase loyalty
- Create a community-driven retail model that connects customers to a larger purpose outside of the core shopping experience
- Continuously create fresh and unique digital (and eventually physical) shopping experiences to drive interest, engagement, and sales

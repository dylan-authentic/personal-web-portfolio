##### Introduction

Understanding customer needs and refining product offerings based on direct feedback is a cornerstone of successful product management. A product initiative I led while at Mediaocean focused on evaluating the viability of our current product by diving deep into customer experiences to extract actionable insights aimed at reducing churn and boosting Net Promoter Scores (NPS).

##### Objective and Approach

The primary goal was to enhance the overall usability and functionality of the product, thereby ensuring it meets and exceeds customer expectations. To achieve this, I created a comprehensive research plan that involved several key activities:

__Client Interviews and Feedback Sessions:__ 
Conducted over several months in close collaboration with Customer Success team, these sessions were instrumental in gathering firsthand insights from users experiencing various levels of satisfaction and engagement with our product.

__Historical Data Review:__
In collaboration with Customer Support and Operations, I analyzed past user interactions and support tickets to identify recurring issues and patterns affecting user satisfaction.

__Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):__
Working collaboratively with cross-functional leadership, we focused on several KPIs to measure the success of our product improvements:

- Net revenue churn reduction
- High product usability measured by product usage trends
- Customer retention and satisfaction rates (NPS/CSAT)

##### Research Participants

Identifying research participants included breaking down client criteria based on Customer Health Score Data. In collaboration with Customer Success, the following groups of research participants were identified:

__Group A:__ Customers with a "Yellow" Custoemr Health Score based on overall product usage, user turnover, or newly signed/onboarded customers

__Group B:__ Customers with "Red" Customer Health Score who have already determined they were not renewing contracts (Feedback was collected via email, CS Account Plans, or directly from Customer Success Reps if unable to schedule an interview)

__Group C:__ Customers with a "Green" Customer Health Score based on long-term power usage

##### Key Themes to Discover
- **What are the most critical needs of the customer?**
- **What are the most annoying challenges faced by the customer within the product today?**
- **What differences can be made to alleviate those challenges for customers?**
- **What do customers love about the product and why?**
- **How are customers alternatively solving their problems today?**

##### Insights and Discoveries

From our research, several themes emerged:

1) Better familiarity with alternative solutions and lack of knowledge of how to use the platform increases dropoff and prevents long-term adoption
2) The user experience of switching between key product areas during user workflows increases level of effort and decreases usage
3) Missing support for updated critical features causes clients to default to alternative solutions
4) Unexpected errors and load time increases friction and slows user workflow

The outcome of this extensive research was a prioritized list of product enhancements tailored to meet the identified needs, solve usability issues, and better cater to our customer base. This strategic approach not only aimed at reducing long-term churn but also at increasing overall user satisfaction and engagement within the platform.

##### Conclusion

This research initiative underscores the importance of continuous customer feedback in shaping product development. By aligning our efforts with the explicit needs of our users, we are better positioned to delight our users and ensure sustained growth and customer satisfaction in the competitive market landscape.

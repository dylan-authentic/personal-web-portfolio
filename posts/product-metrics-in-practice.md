##### Introduction

In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, leveraging data to inform product decisions is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage. A project I led while at Mediaocean focused on establishing a robust framework for tracking and enhancing product performance, which proved instrumental in aligning our development efforts with customer satisfaction and business growth.

##### Defining Growth Metrics

The cornerstone of the strategy was the development of a hierarchical metric system to capture and analyze product performance effectively. Collaboratively with my product team, I identified a primary "Focus Metric" that served as a guiding beacon for all product-related decisions, ensuring alignment with our long-term vision and immediate business needs. This metric was chosen for its direct correlation with revenue growth and customer value reception.

##### Strategic Metric Identification

To support the main metric, I led several collaborative sessions with my product team, including product leads and directors, to establish several "Leading Indicator Metrics." These were carefully selected to provide early signals about the trends in our focus metric, covering diverse aspects such as customer acquisition, engagement, retention, and monetization. Each leading indicator was backed by a set of input metrics, allowing for granular analysis and actionable insights.

###### Focus Metric (L1):

**Subscribed Ad Spend:** Chosen for its direct correlation with revenue growth, its demonstration of customer value perception, alignment with long-term goals, and adaptability to insights gained over time.

###### Leading Indicators (L2):

**Ad Account Subscription Rate:** Tracks new customer acquisition and expansion within existing accounts, directly influencing the primary revenue-driving metric.

**Time to Group Activation:** Measures the speed at which users realize the product's core value, impacting customer satisfaction and subsequent ad spend.

**Key Active Engagements:** Indicates user engagement frequency, reflecting the productâ€™s ability to retain users and sustain their ad spend over time.

**28-Day Usage Retention:** Tracks sustained product usage, signaling ongoing customer value and contribution to revenue retention.

##### Methodological Approach
Within the process of further identifying valuable metrics, I worked within 3 core problem-solving pillars: 1) Validating our Key User Archetypes 2) Identifying Key Value Moments for those User Archetypes, and Identifying Key Areas of Impact that can be influenced by Product Development.

**User Archetype Validation:**
Understanding our target users was pivotal. I collaborated with Customer Success and Product Marketing to analyze various user roles within the ecosystem, such as planners, buyers, and analysts, and tailor our metrics and product functionalities to meet their specific needs.

**Value Moments Identification:**
Using frameworks like **Jobs to be Done** and the **Ladder of Needs**, I looked across our product offering to pinpoint critical value moments for our users. These insights helped refine our metric strategy to ensure metrics were aimed at enhancing user satisfaction and performance efficacy.

**Product Drivers for Success:**
Again, working collaboratively across my product team in multiple working sessions, I delved into identifying key product drivers that could significantly impact customer success. This involved a mix of qualitative insights and quantitative data to ensure our product not only meets but exceeds user expectations.

##### Implementation and Tracking

The implementation phase involved integrating tracking tools such as Pendo.io as well as internal data from disparate sources to build out a metrics dashboard as well as analytic reports. This setup not only provided us with a real-time overview of our product's health but also enabled iterative improvements based on our insights.

##### Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was ensuring the flexibility of our metrics to adapt to initial learnings and market changes, while also ensuring leading indicators were truly indicative of success for our product. This adaptive approach required a blend of strategic thinking, experimentation, and flexibility, which was cultivated through ongoing team collaboration and refinement.

##### Conclusion

The project not only introduced accountability amongst our product team for measuring and driving outcomes for our leading indicators, but also enhanced our understanding of strategic metric implementation and reinforced the importance of aligning product development with user needs and business objectives. The iterative process of metric evaluation and refinement has become a core aspect of our product strategy, fostering a culture of continuous improvement, definition and measurement of success, and customer-focus.

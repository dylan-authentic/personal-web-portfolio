##### Overview
Determing the pricing of a product is a unique challenge and opportunity that not only impacts revenue generation but also influences product strategy at a high level. As a product manager, understanding the high level business goals of a product offering can shape the Go-To-Market strategy, MVP and feature roadmap priorities, as well as customer perception and overall adoption. If pricing doesn't align with customer expectations, there could be a lower rate of adoption that plummets the potential success of a product. If pricing doesn't align with business objectives, the investment into the development of the product along with it's hidden costs may not be worth the value to the business. This post outlines pricing from three pillars: 1) Business Objectives 2) Pricing Strategy 3) Pricing Model

###### Business Objectives / Goals of Product Pricing
When launching a new product or managing an existing product, it's key to understand the high level business objectives that the product aims to fulfill. As PMs, we're responsible for aligning product development to serve customer needs, ultimately driving value for the business. The business objective determined for a product area impacts the pricing strategy that is pursued and the pricing model that is deployed. Below are a list of 8 business objectives that are relevant when breaking down the problem of "how do we price this product?"...

**Revenue Maximization**
- The price attracts customers and maximizes total revenue

**Market Penetration**
- The price is used as a tool to penetrate a market or increase market share by setting prices lower to attract customers away from competitors

**Profit Maximization**
- The price is set to achieve the highest possible profit by factoring in the cost of goods sold into the final price

**Customer Segmentation**
- The price is set differently to appeal to different customer segments, maximizing the overall market coverage and profitability from different groups

**Product Positioning**
- The price is used to positin the product in a specific way amongst customers in the market (I.e., Luxury Goods vs Mass Market Goods)

**Demand Management**
- The price is used to control demand over time, starting with initial higher prices to skim profits from early adopters and reducing over time for price sensitive customers

**Cost Recovery**
- The price is used to recover R&D costs within a specific timeframe

**Complementary Pricing**
- The price is used to enhance sales and profitability of other products in a portfolio

###### Pricing Strategy
Once the objective of the business is determined as to why a specific product should be pursued, or what the outcomes of pursuing a specific product may be, the pricing strategy can be derived and aligned on amongst internal stakeholders, bringing us one step closer to the final pricing model. Below are a breakdown of most common pricing strategies as well as alternative strategies that can be employed depending on the goals and objectives of the business.

**Value-Based Pricing**
- The price is set based on an estimated or perceived value ($) that the customer will receive from the product

**Penetration Pricing**
- The price is intentionally set lower in order to quickly grow and attract customers

**Competitive Pricing**
- The price is set based on the pricing structure of competitors

**Cost-plus Pricing**
- The price is set based on all COGS or (Cost of Revenue), including fixed and variable expenses plus a markup to represent profit margin

**Skimming Pricing**
- The price starts high and lowers over time

**Usage-Based Pricing**
- The price is set based on product or service consumption

Alternatives:
- Dynamic Pricing
- Tiered Pricing
- Bundle Pricing
- Loss-Leader Pricing
- Freemium Pricing
- Promotional Pricing
- Two-Part Pricing
- Psychological Pricing

###### Pricing Model
After determining the pricing goals and pricing strategy, we can land on a pricing model aimed at implementing our strategy and achieving our objectives. The pricing model is a tactical implementation of our strategy, and multiple models can be deployed at the same time to best drive our outcomes. In practice, the pricing model , strategy, and objective is discussed simultanesously as tradeoffs and implications are being considered for each.

**Subscription Model**
- Recurring fee at regular intervals

**Freemium Model**
- Free for access to basic features with a premium cost for access to advanced features

**Tiered Model**
- Different prices for different levels of the product

**Pay-Per-Use Model**
- Charge for the amount of service used

**Bundle Model**
- Multiple products or services are sold together as a package

**Transaction Model**
- Charged for each individual transaction

**Seat-based Model**
- Charged a fixed amount for each "seat" or user that has access to the product

**Two-Part Model**
- Charged a fixed fee + variable fee for usage

**Dynamic Model**
- Adjusted in real-time based on various factors

**Bulk Model**
- Charged lower price per unit for purchasing larger quantities of product

###### Examples: Models -> Strategies
1) Subscription Model -> Freemium, Tiered, Value-Based, Usage-Based Strategies
2) Freemium Model -> Penetration and Promotional Strategies
3) Tiered Model -> Value-Based, Competitive, and Tiered Strategies
4) Pay-Per-Use -> Usage-Based Strategy
5) Bundle Model -> Bundle and Promotional Strategies

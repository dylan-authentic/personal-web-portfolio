##### Multi-Dimensional Arrays

Before approaching multi-dimensional arrays, it's important to understand the concept of [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)).
- A matrix is a contiguous collection of elements arranged in rows and columns. (Typically resembling a rectangular array) __Row = the elements that are aligned from side to side; Column = the elements that are aligned from top to bottom__
The following is an example of a 2 x 3 matrix (2 rows, 3 columns)
```
[[1   9   -13]
 [20  5   -6]]
 ```
 - Typically, each matrix has the same number of rows and columns - thus two matrices can be added or subtracted element by element.
 - In order to do matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix

##### Memory Allocation for Multi-Dimensional Arrays 
#
##### Row-major vs Column-Major
- **Row-major** memory allocation **for 2D arrays** places the elements of the first row right after each other in a contiguous memory block, then the second, and so on...
- **Column-major** memory allocation **for 2D arrays** places the elements of the first column right after each other in a contiguous memory block, then the second column, and so on...

> In my own words, the row-major memory layout organizes the elements of a matrix by row into a sequential memory block, and the column-major memory layout organizes the elements of a matrix by column into a sequential memory block

__Note for programming purposes: In a row-major memory layout, the column indices change the fastest (vice versa for column-major)__
